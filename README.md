In this lab we have developed a Rock, Paper and Scissors game.
The game is a two players mode which means the user's opponent will be a computer.
The game starts by asking the user to make a choice (rock, paper, scissors), if the choice is valid then the computer will randomly makes a choice and the winner will be declared.
In case of an invalid input, an error will be displayed asking the user to try again.
After declaring the winner, user will be asked whether to play again or exit. If the user would like to play again then the game will start from the beginning otherwise the game will end.
